### Bridgerton
From Shondaland and creator Chris Van Dusen, the first season of Bridgerton follows Daphne Bridgerton (Pheobe Dynevor), the eldest daughter of the powerful Bridgerton family as she makes her debut onto Regency London's competitive marriage market. Hoping to follow in her parent's footsteps and find a match sparked by true love, Daphne's prospects initially seem to be unrivaled. But as her older brother (Jonathan Bailey) begins to rule out her potential suitors, the high society scandal sheet written by the mysterious Lady Whistledown (Julie Andrews) casts aspersions on Daphne. Enter the highly desirable and rebellious Duke of Hastings (Reg√©-Jean Page), committed bachelor and the catch of the season for the debutantes' mamas. Despite proclaiming that they want nothing the other has to offer, their attraction is undeniable and sparks fly as they find themselves engaged in an increasing battle of wits while navigating society's expectations for their future.
